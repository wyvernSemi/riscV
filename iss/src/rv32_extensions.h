// Define the inheritance chain for adding new extensions.
// Currently this is setup to add Zicsr, M, A, F, and D
// in that order. If an extension were to be skipped,
// then the subsequent definition just uses the last
// active class to inherit from in place of the skipped
// class. Note, since the FENCE instruction is a NOP
// in this model, Zifencei is implicit in the rv32i_cpu
// base class.
